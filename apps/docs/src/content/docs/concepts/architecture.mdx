## Overview

Minions OpenClaw uses a monorepo structure with three main packages:

- **@minions-openclaw/core** — TypeScript library with all business logic
- **@minions-openclaw/cli** — Command-line interface built on Commander.js
- **minions-openclaw (Python)** — Python SDK with equivalent functionality

## Key Components

### InstanceManager
Manages the lifecycle of OpenClaw Gateway instances.

### GatewayClient
WebSocket client implementing the OpenClaw connection protocol.

### ConfigDecomposer
Parses openclaw.json configuration into a tree of minions.

### SnapshotManager
Captures and compares point-in-time state snapshots.

## What is Minions OpenClaw?

**Minions OpenClaw** (or OpenClaw Manager) is a management layer for [OpenClaw Gateway](https://github.com/mxn2020/openclaw) instances. It lets you register, monitor, snapshot, and configure gateways from a unified CLI, TypeScript SDK, or Python SDK.

Every piece of state — registered instances, configuration snapshots, agent definitions, channel settings — is stored as a **Minion** (a typed, versioned structured object), giving you full audit history and diff capabilities out of the box.

## Who is it for?

- **DevOps engineers** managing multiple OpenClaw Gateway deployments
- **Platform teams** that need version-controlled gateway configurations
- **AI teams** wanting snapshot-based rollback and config diffing

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Instance Registry" icon="pencil">
    Register any OpenClaw Gateway with a URL, auth token, and optional RSA device key.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Snapshot System" icon="add-document">
    Capture point-in-time state (agents, channels, models, config) and traverse the version chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Config Decomposition" icon="approve-check">
    Decompose a gateway config JSON into a typed minion tree and recompose it back.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Config Diff" icon="setting">
    Compare any two configs or snapshots at the field level — instantly see what changed.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

1. **Register** a gateway instance with connection details
2. **Snapshot** the current state to create a versioned record
3. **Compare** snapshots to see exactly what changed between versions
4. **Decompose** configs into typed minions for fine-grained management
5. **Restore** a previous configuration if something goes wrong

# Building a Gateway Dashboard

One of the most common requests from OpenClaw users is a visual overview of their gateway instances. In this tutorial, we will build a simple dashboard that connects to your gateway, lists instances, and displays live configuration data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- An OpenClaw Gateway instance running locally or remotely
- The `@minions-openclaw/sdk` package

```bash
npm install @minions-openclaw/sdk
```

## Connecting to Your Gateway

The SDK provides a straightforward client that handles authentication and connection management:

```typescript
import { OpenClawClient } from '@minions-openclaw/sdk';

const client = new OpenClawClient({
  url: process.env.GATEWAY_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
  apiKey: process.env.GATEWAY_API_KEY,
});

// Verify the connection
const status = await client.healthCheck();
console.log(`Gateway status: ${status.healthy ? 'OK' : 'UNREACHABLE'}`);
```

<Callout type="info">
The SDK automatically retries failed connections and provides detailed error messages when a gateway is unreachable.
</Callout>

## Listing Instances

If you manage multiple gateway instances, you can list and filter them:

```typescript
const instances = await client.listInstances();

for (const instance of instances) {
  console.log(`${instance.name} — ${instance.region} — ${instance.status}`);
}
```

## Taking and Comparing Snapshots

The real power of the SDK is its snapshot system. Take snapshots before and after configuration changes to see exactly what was modified:

```typescript
// Before a config change
const before = await client.createSnapshot({ label: 'before-update' });

// ... make your config changes ...

// After the change
const after = await client.createSnapshot({ label: 'after-update' });

// Diff the two snapshots
const diff = await client.diffSnapshots(before.id, after.id);
console.log(`${diff.additions} additions, ${diff.deletions} deletions`);
```

<Callout type="tip">
Combine snapshot diffs with your CI/CD pipeline to automatically flag unexpected configuration changes before they reach production.
</Callout>

## What You Can Build From Here

This basic dashboard can be extended with:

- **Real-time model usage** — Track which LLM models are being called and their latency
- **Config history timeline** — Visual timeline of all snapshots with diff views
- **Alert rules** — Get notified when configuration drift is detected between instances

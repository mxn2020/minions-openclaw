# Bringing OpenClaw to Python

While our TypeScript SDK has been the primary interface for Minions OpenClaw, the reality is that many infrastructure and DevOps teams prefer Python for their automation workflows. Today, we're releasing the **Minions OpenClaw Python SDK**.

<Callout type="info">
The Python SDK mirrors the TypeScript SDK's API design while remaining idiomatic to Python developers, using async/await and Pydantic for type safety.
</Callout>

## Installation

```bash
pip install minions-openclaw
```

## Managing Instances from Python

```python
from minions_openclaw import InstanceManager

manager = InstanceManager()

# Register a gateway instance
instance = manager.register(
    name="prod-gateway",
    url="wss://gateway.prod.example.com"
)

# List all instances
for inst in manager.list():
    print(f"{inst.name}: {inst.url} ({inst.status})")
```

## Snapshot Workflows

The snapshot system works identically to the TypeScript version, making it easy for mixed-language teams.

```python
from minions_openclaw import SnapshotManager

snapshots = SnapshotManager()

# Capture a point-in-time snapshot
snapshot = snapshots.capture(instance.id)

# Later, diff against current state
diff = snapshots.diff(snapshot.id, "current")
for change in diff.changes:
    print(f"  {change.path}: {change.old_value} → {change.new_value}")
```

## Gateway Client

Connect directly to OpenClaw Gateway instances via WebSocket for real-time monitoring.

```python
from minions_openclaw import GatewayClient

async with GatewayClient(url="wss://gateway.prod.example.com") as client:
    status = await client.get_status()
    print(f"Gateway uptime: {status.uptime_seconds}s")
    print(f"Active connections: {status.active_connections}")
```

<Callout type="tip">
The Python SDK uses `websockets` under the hood, making it compatible with any Python async framework including FastAPI, aiohttp, and Django Channels.
</Callout>

## Cross-Language Config Sync

One of the most powerful patterns is using both SDKs together — TypeScript for your web dashboard and Python for backend automation scripts.

A snapshot captured from the TypeScript CLI can be restored using the Python SDK, and vice versa. The serialization format is identical.

## Get Started

Install the SDK, check out the [documentation](https://openclaw.minions.help), and start managing your gateways with confidence.

```bash
pip install minions-openclaw
```

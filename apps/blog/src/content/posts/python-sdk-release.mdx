# Python SDK for Minions OpenClaw

We are excited to announce the release of the **Minions OpenClaw Python SDK** — bringing the same powerful gateway management capabilities to the Python ecosystem.

<Callout type="info">
Many infrastructure and DevOps teams prefer Python for their automation scripts. The Python SDK provides full feature parity with the TypeScript SDK.
</Callout>

## Installation

```bash
pip install minions-openclaw
```

## Quick Start

```python
from minions_openclaw import OpenClawClient

client = OpenClawClient(
    url="https://gateway.example.com",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# List all gateway instances
instances = client.list_instances()
for instance in instances:
    print(f"{instance.name} — {instance.status}")
```

## Snapshot Management

The Python SDK makes it easy to integrate snapshot management into your existing DevOps workflows:

```python
# Take a pre-deployment snapshot
snapshot = client.create_snapshot(label="pre-deploy-v2.3")

# After deploying, diff against the snapshot
diff = client.diff_snapshots(snapshot.id, "current")
if diff.has_changes:
    print(f"Config changed: {diff.additions} additions, {diff.deletions} deletions")
```

## CI/CD Integration

The Python SDK works great in CI/CD pipelines. Use it to validate that your gateway configuration matches your expected state:

```python
import sys
from minions_openclaw import OpenClawClient

client = OpenClawClient(url="https://gateway.example.com")

# Compare staging vs production
diff = client.diff_instances("staging", "production")
if diff.has_unexpected_changes:
    print("ERROR: Unexpected config drift detected!")
    sys.exit(1)
```

<Callout type="tip">
Add this check as a step in your GitHub Actions workflow to catch configuration drift before it causes issues.
</Callout>

## Language Interoperability

Both the TypeScript and Python SDKs use the same snapshot format and API protocol, so you can mix and match them in your workflow. Take a snapshot with the TypeScript CLI, restore it with the Python SDK — it all works seamlessly.

## Get Involved

The Python SDK is open source and available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/minions-openclaw/). We welcome contributions and feedback — check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mxn2020/minions-openclaw) to get started.

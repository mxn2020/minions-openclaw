# Why Gateway Management Matters

Running an AI-powered application in production means managing infrastructure that is inherently stateful and configuration-heavy. OpenClaw Gateway instances hold routing rules, model assignments, rate-limit policies, and authentication tokens — and when you have multiple environments (dev, staging, production), keeping them in sync becomes a nightmare.

**Minions OpenClaw** is a purpose-built toolkit for managing, monitoring, and version-controlling your OpenClaw Gateway instances.

<Callout type="info">
Minions OpenClaw brings the "infrastructure as code" philosophy to your AI gateway stack — track changes, diff configurations, and roll back with confidence.
</Callout>

## The Problem

Most teams manage gateway configurations through dashboards or ad-hoc scripts. This creates several pain points:

- **Configuration drift** between environments
- **No audit trail** for who changed what and when
- **Risky deployments** — one wrong toggle and your production routing breaks
- **Manual backup** processes that are easy to forget

## How Minions OpenClaw Solves This

### Config Snapshots

Take a point-in-time snapshot of your entire gateway configuration. Snapshots are immutable, diffable, and can be restored at any time.

```typescript
import { OpenClawClient } from '@minions-openclaw/sdk';

const client = new OpenClawClient({ url: 'https://gateway.example.com' });

// Take a snapshot before making changes
const snapshot = await client.createSnapshot({ label: 'pre-migration' });
console.log(`Snapshot ${snapshot.id} created at ${snapshot.createdAt}`);
```

### Config Decomposition

Instead of treating your gateway config as one giant blob, OpenClaw decomposes it into logical sections (routes, models, policies) that can be managed independently.

### Multi-Instance Management

Connect to multiple gateway instances from a single CLI session. Compare configurations across environments and promote changes from staging to production.

<Callout type="tip">
Use `openclaw diff staging production` to see exactly what's different between environments before promoting changes.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

The `@minions-openclaw/sdk` is available on NPM, along with a CLI tool and a web-based dashboard. We are actively developing the Python SDK for teams that prefer Python-based infrastructure tooling.

We invite you to read the docs, try the CLI, and join us on GitHub!

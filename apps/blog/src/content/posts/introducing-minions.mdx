# Taking Control of Your AI Gateways

Managing AI gateways — the infrastructure that routes, rate-limits, and secures LLM traffic — is one of the most operationally demanding parts of running an AI-powered product. Configuration sprawl, version drift, and zero visibility into what changed and when are the norm.

**Minions OpenClaw** changes that.

<Callout type="info">
Minions OpenClaw is an open-source project built on the Minions SDK that brings version control, monitoring, and declarative configuration to your OpenClaw Gateway instances.
</Callout>

## The Gateway Management Problem

A typical team operating AI gateways faces these pain points daily:

1. **Configuration drift** — Prod and staging configs diverge silently
2. **No audit trail** — "Who changed the rate limit last Tuesday?"
3. **Risky deployments** — One bad config change can break every downstream consumer
4. **Multi-instance sprawl** — Managing 5+ gateway instances with different configs

## How Minions OpenClaw Helps

### Instance Management

Register and track all your OpenClaw Gateway instances from a single pane of glass.

```typescript
import { createMinionsOpenClaw } from '@minions-openclaw/sdk';

const client = createMinionsOpenClaw();

// Register a gateway instance
const instance = await client.instances.register({
  name: 'production-us-east',
  url: 'wss://gateway-us-east.example.com',
  environment: 'production'
});
```

### Snapshot System

Capture point-in-time snapshots of your gateway configuration. Compare, diff, and restore at any time.

```typescript
// Capture current state
const snapshot = await client.snapshots.capture(instance.id);

// Later, compare with current state
const diff = await client.snapshots.diff(snapshot.id, 'current');
console.log(`${diff.changes.length} config changes detected`);
```

### Config Decomposition

Break monolithic gateway configs into manageable, auditable sections.

```typescript
const decomposed = await client.config.decompose(instance.id);
// Returns: { routing: {...}, rateLimiting: {...}, auth: {...}, ... }
```

<Callout type="tip">
Config decomposition is especially powerful when combined with snapshots — you can track changes at the section level rather than diffing entire config blobs.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

We're actively building the CLI (`@minions-openclaw/cli`), the Python SDK, and a full dashboard web app. Check out the [documentation](https://openclaw.minions.help) to get started, and join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/mxn2020/minions-openclaw)!
